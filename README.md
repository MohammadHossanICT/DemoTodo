# DemoTodo

This is simple demo the show CRUD opertion using REST API function(GET , POST, PUT, DELETE). Although the server is not updaing the record but I got the rcord updated locally . As far API Documentation is saying the POST , PUT , DELETE actually does not update any but for testing purpose if the we get status code 200 , that means it woking fine. Here is the API Doc link .
