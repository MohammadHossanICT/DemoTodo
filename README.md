# DemoTodo

This is simple demo the show CRUD opertion using REST API function(GET , POST, PUT, DELETE). Although the server is not updaing the record but I got the rcord updated locally . As far API Documentation is saying the POST , PUT , DELETE actually does not update any but for testing purpose if the we get status code 200 , that means it woking fine. Here is the API Doc link .

https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos. 

Here is the Json link for for encoding and decoding the json form API call. 

https://dummyjson.com/todos.

For this I have used the SwiftUI and MVVM architecture pattern to complete the coding challenge. The concurrecy was handle by using Swift async and await which is most recommended was to handle the concurrency.

Here is the screenshot when we run the app initially and it displaying the Todo List (GET request)..
